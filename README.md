🎯 Objective

To build a Java console application that checks whether a given input is a palindrome, developed step-by-step using use cases.

🔄 Project Procedure (What I Did)

Defined the project objective.

Broke the system into use cases.

Implemented Use Case 1:

Created the main class.

Implemented the main() method.

Displayed welcome message and version.

Structured the project for future expansion (input + palindrome logic).

🌊 Project Flow

Start → JVM calls main() → Display Welcome Message → Display Version → Ready for Next Use Case → End / Continue
